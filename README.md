# SingleFlowDCRBlock

This project covers two conceptually different things (which may one day be
split to two different projects):

- `SingleFlowDCRBlock`, a SMS++ :Block for Single-Flow Delay-Constrained Routing
  Problems

- one day, specific :Solver for the problem


## Getting started

These instructions will let you build `SingleFlowDCRBlock` on your system.


### Requirements

- The [SMS++ core library](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp) and its
  requirements.


### Build and install with CMake

Configure and build the library with:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The library has the same configuration options of
[SMS++](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration).

Optionally, install the library in the system with:

```sh
sudo make install
```


### Usage with CMake

After the library is built, you can use it in your CMake project with:

```cmake
find_package(SingleFlowDCRBlock)
target_link_libraries(<my_target> SMS++:: SingleFlowDCRBlock)
```


### Build and install with makefiles

Carefully hand-crafted makefiles have also been developed for those unwilling
to use CMake. General instructions are:

- The arrangements of folders must be that envisioned by the
  [Umbrella SMS++ Project](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project)

- The main step is to edit the makefiles into ../extlib/. There is one for
  each of the external libraries that any module requires, starting with

  = [Boost](https://www.boost.org)

  = [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)

  = [netCDF-C++](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf)

  that are required by the "core" SMS++ library and therefore by everyone.
  Setting the

```make
lib*INC = -I< paths to include files directories >
lib*LIB = -L< paths to lib files directories > -l< libs >
```

  in each allows one to set any non-standard path if the library is not
  installed in the system (or leave them empty if they are).

- The "core" SMS++ classes have a makefile for building the corresponding
  library in

```sh
SMS++/lib/makefile-lib
```

  The makefile allow to choose the compiler name and the optimization/debug.
  This builds the lib/libSMS++.a that can be linked upon. Also, the

```sh
SMS++/lib/makefile-inc
```

  file is provided for allowing external makefiles to ensure that the library
  is up-to-date (useful in case one is actually developing it).

  Note that the "basic" makefile macros

```make
CC =
SW =
```

  for setting the C++ compiler and its options are "automatically forwarded"
  from the makefile to these of the other SMS++ components, and therefore
  (possibly at the cost of a make clean) ensure consistency during the
  building process.
